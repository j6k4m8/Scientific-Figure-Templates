# Scientific Figure Templates

Templates for designing figures for a scientific paper. Few journals actually require perfect adherence to style-guides, and practically no one will tell you that you have to match the image bounds of the journal to the pixel. But why not make your figures the best they can be?

## Illustrator

Each template file has:
* One "main" document page, that shows the general layout of the figures on the finished, published page.
* One artboard for each figure type (full-width; single-column, if the journal supports it; and full-page).

Important notes:
* Figure _heights_ are not specified, since you can generally reflow your text around whatever height figure you create. But the widths are important!
* These are NOT paper templates for document editing. They are strictly for figure design: The bounding boxes of the document pages, each figure, and the text columns are designed to perfectly match that of the print manuscripts (so you can coordinate font sizes and layout).
